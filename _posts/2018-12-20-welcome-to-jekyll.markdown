After several months of online discussion, we have joined together to launch the Digital Monetary Fund project.

Our goal is to use blockchain technology to implement theories of Monetarist Economic Theory in new digital world.

A Digital Autonomous Organisation (DAO) will govern the Fiscal Policy of the Digital Monetary Fund to create the world's first democratic and distributed monetary system.
