We have deployed a full Ethereum node using Geth in a data centre.

This has been done to better facilitate development of ERC20 Smart Contracts for the Digital Monetary Fund project. In the longer term we hope running a full node will also reduce transaction processing costs.

When the project is ready for production four full nodes will be implemented in data centres on different continents.
