Our plan has been to create a blockchain master token that both provides liquidity and also a mechanism for member voting rights for management of the Digital Monetary Fund project.

However, the recent SEC legal action against Ripple (XRP) in the USA was unexpected and has led to a decision to delay this until there is clarity of the situation. 

Development of the project will continue to be self-funded and managed by existing members.
