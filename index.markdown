In 2015 the Peatio crypto exchange platform was released as an open-source project. Helios/Openware took over development of the Peatio project around 2017, and significantly extended and enhanced the platform.

In 2023 Openware/Yellow developed a proprietory exchange platform and ceased work on th ePeatio/Opendax project.
The Peatio DAO is dedicated to further developing, maintaining and supporting the Peatio platform as an open-source project.
