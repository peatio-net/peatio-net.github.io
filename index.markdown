In 2015 the Peatio crypto exchange platform was released as an open-source project.

**Peatio Blockchain Resources Network:** A collection of open-source resources for Digital Asset Exchanges based on the Peatio project.

We are working to deploy shared blockchain nodes for Peatio exchanges.

We will do this by using blockchain digital assets and networks for an inflation-proof, transparent and trust-less monetary system.
