About the Digital Monetary Fund Project

After several months of online discussion during 2018, we joined together to launch the Digital Monetary Fund project.

Our goal is to use blockchain technology to implement theories of Monetarist Economic Theory in new digital world.

A Digital Autonomous Organisation (DAO) will govern the Fiscal Policy of the Digital Monetary Fund to create the worldâ€™s first democratic and distributed monetary system.

Success depends on democracy, independence and transparency. All of the code that runs the Digital Monetary Fund project is open-source and available on a public git repositories to allow collaboration and peer-review.

**The Leadership Team**

The Digital Monetary Fund is managed by a seasoned team of financial markets and technical experts. We share a common philosophy of how blockchain and cryptography technology can be harnessed to deliver the promises of Modern Monetary Economic Theory. Management is driven by a shared commitment to the principles of a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO).
