**Financial Sector for the 2020s:** Building a More Democratic, Inclusive and Transparent Monetary System for the new decade.

The Digital Monetary Fund aims to link national fiat currencies with stable block-chain based crypto currencies to enable friction-less, risk-free and universal monetary flows.

We will do this by using blockchain digital assets and networks for an inflation-proof, transparent and trust-less monetary system.
